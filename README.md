DATA ANALYSIS is the process of collecting, storing, modeling, and analyzing data that can inform executive decision-making, and the demand for skilled data analysts has never been greater. 

This program will teach you the foundational data skills employers are seeking for entry-level data analytics roles. It will not only help you start your career in data analytics, but also provides a strong foundation for future career development in other paths such as data science, artificial intelligence, deep learning, or data engineering. 

You’ll learn the latest skills and tools used by professional data analysts including Excel spreadsheets, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter Notebooks, Cognos Analytics, and more. You’ll work with a variety of data sources and project scenarios to gain practical experience with data manipulation and applying analytical skills. You'll also have the option to learn how generative AI tools and techniques are used in data analysis.

In addition to a portfolio of projects and a Professional Certificate from IBM to showcase your expertise, you’ll earn an IBM Digital badge and gain access to career resources to help you in your job search.

This program is ACE® and FIBAA recommended—when you complete, you can earn up to 12 college credits and 6 ECTS credits.

Applied Learning Project

Throughout the program, you’ll complete hands-on projects and labs and gain a firm grasp on the required technical skills to effectively gather, wrangle, mine, and visualize data, as well as the soft skills for working with stakeholders and storytelling with data to engage your audience.

Projects you’ll complete:

- Import, clean, and analyze fleet vehicle inventory with Excel pivot tables
- Use car sales key performance indicator (KPI) data to create an interactive dashboard with visualizations
- Extract and graph financial data with the Pandas data analysis Python library
- Use SQL to query census, crime, and school demographic data sets
- Wrangle data, graph plots, and create regression models to predict housing prices with data science Python libraries
- Create a dynamic Python dashboard to monitor, report, and improve US domestic flight reliability
- At the end of the program, you complete a real-world capstone project specifically designed to showcase your newly learned data analyst skills.
